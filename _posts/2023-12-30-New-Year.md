Here we are and it's actually going to be 2024 in a couple of days. I can't believe time passed so quickly. This year was filled with a lot of ups and downs which has helped me clarify my purpose just a little bit! 

This was a year of hardcore mental toughness facing loss,  and mortalityand I'm trying to carry that over to this new chapter. One things for sure and two things are for certain is the only thing promised in life is change. I hate change. But now, it's about having an attitude of gratitude about the people, places, and things that mean a lot to me. This comes with the realization that nothing is forever. So change is inevitable, why not embrace it? Otherwise, everything will feel like an uphill battle. And I don't want to look old in the face from fighting gravity. 

So I raise my glass to new mindsets, new friends, new skills, and new community. Heartfelt thanks to those that remained solid and the friends I haven't met yet. And a gentle reminder that every morning is a promise that life can change if different choices are made. 

Positive vibes, awesome breakthroughs, challenging puzzles, and life-changing good fortune to all!!
